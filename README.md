### **View Postings**

Posting, or *trip*, refers to an article that is posted by a user to record their trip. It contains information including the title, the date, the journey, the author, the destination, the images, and the body.

#### **View Individual Posting** `/trip/:pid`

User can view the posting of the corresponding `pid`, e.g., accessing `/trip/1` will display the posting with pid 1; in mock, there is only one posting and will not be varied by pid. Note that there are images for a post, if there are multiple images... The client can click on the journey name to access the journey page and click on the author name to see the author's profile

#### **Journey Page** `/journey/:jid`

A journey page contains a collection of postings with the same journey category tag (each category corresponds to a jid). This page can be access from user profile page and click on a journey's title or from a posting and click the journey name. When user is at a posting view page or a profile page, they can enter the journey page by pressing the journey category tag, and they will be directed to the journey page with the correponding jid; User can access the corresponding posting pages by clicking the postings on journey page; In mock, there is only one journey page and the content will not be varied by jid

### **Profile Page**

Profile page contains the user information (avatar, username, nickname, user description) and the postings posted by the user (organized according to its journey category tag); Only the user themselves can edit that profile page, and if a person is not logged in to the corresponding user account but accessed it directly through url extension `/profile/uid`, that user can only see the posting and profile information without permission to edit anything.

#### **View Profile** `/profile/uid`

This is the page that displays the profile of the user whose user id is the uid from the url. This page can be access from any post by click on the author name or click the profile button on nav bar as a logged-in user. If the current user logged in as the owner of the profile, he/she will see a edit profile button on the top right corner of the profile page.

#### **Edit Profile**

This is a modal that hovers on the view profile page, and the user will be able to modify the avatar, nickname and self description on that modal (the user will not be allowed to change the username); After successfully modifying the user profile, message will appear on the top of browserto indicate that the user profile has been modified, and the profile information on the view profile page will be modified once the page is auto refreshed.

### **Admin**

There is no direct access methods from client pages to the admin dashboard. The only way to access admin dashboard is to access `/admin/login` route.

There are four pages for the admin dashboard: login, home, user management, and post management. If an user tries to access pages other than the login page without using the admin account, the user will be redirected to the admin login page.

#### **Admin Login** `/admin/login`

The admin account has *admin* as both the username and the password. Login with other username or password will only show a warning.

#### **Admin Home Page** `/admin/home`

There is nothing on the home page except a welcome message with the current admin name and the navbar.

#### **Users Management Page** `/admin/users`

This page will have a table showing all users we have, and their info such as the username, the nickname and the last login time. There are two ways to manage a user: switch its role and ban/unban it. The button `Inactive` will ban a user so that he will not be able to login. If a user is currently banned, the button become `Active` which can be used by admin to unban the user. The other button is to set a user to admin or client and it works in the same way as ban/unban button

#### **Postings Management Page** `/admin/postings`

This page is the same as the users management page, but an admin will have the ability to remove an existing post. Note that private post will not show up here and can't be removed by admin

### **Map**

On every page, a map will be shown on the right. The map can be moved around by holding and dragging the cursor. A user 
can also zoom in or zoom out of the map by scrolling the mouse. The map contains different location markers corresponding 
to each page. Each marker corresponds to a specific post. Clicking on any of the markers will show a popup box with the post's
title and date. In the editing mode, a user can click on anywhere of the map to generate a new marker.

#### **Home Page**
